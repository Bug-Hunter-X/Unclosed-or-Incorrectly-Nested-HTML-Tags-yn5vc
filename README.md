# Unclosed or Incorrectly Nested HTML Tags in HTML
This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in HTML: unclosed or incorrectly nested tags.  Unclosed tags lead to rendering problems, while improper nesting can cause unexpected behavior and layout issues. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected version.

**To reproduce the bug:**
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected rendering or layout problems.

**To view the solution:**
1. Open `bugSolution.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the correct rendering and layout.  Note how properly closed and nested tags lead to a well-structured webpage.

This example highlights the importance of paying close attention to tag structure when writing HTML.  Even seemingly minor errors can significantly impact the final rendered result.
